# Obsidian OCR Plugin

With this plugin you can extract the text of image attachments. It will create an annotation document next to the image document. This will contain a link to the image and the extracted text.

If you search for text, that is part of the image, it will yield the annotation document.

# Remarks
**Note**: This plugin is not in the official list of plugins, yet. You need to [install it manually](#Manually-installing-the-plugin).

**Note**: The process of extracting the text from the image is not done locally. The plugin uses an online API hosted at https://ocr.taskbone.com.

The image data is stored as long as neccessary for the text extraction and deleted immediately after that.

However, if this is a dealbreaker for you, see [Alternatives](#Alternatives).
